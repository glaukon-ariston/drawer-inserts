Create OpenSCAD model for 3D printing with the following description:
- it is an open box
- outside dimensions are
    - width 70mm
    - depth 105mm
    - height 100mm
- the wall thickness is 2mm
- the corners should be rounded with radius 4mm

The box should be stackable as well as easily printable with a 3D printer without a support.

Create GEMINI.md with the model description and instructions how to export the model for 3D printing.
It will be printed using Creality Ender 3 3D printer.

Ask me any clarifying question before creating any arifacts.
